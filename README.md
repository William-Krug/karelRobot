# Karel Robot

## Description

_Duration: 1 Semester_

This series of Java files started as an early assignment, in my Java class at [Normandale Community College](www.normandale.edu), creating a simply robot (ur-Robot) and expanded to include further functionality. OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles were used to take Richard Pattis's Karel Robot programming languages and institute it in Java. Eventually a "super" robot was created that interacted with a built up world, walls, beepers, and other robots. All of the files are of my own design except for "Direction.java" which was provided to the class by our instructor.
