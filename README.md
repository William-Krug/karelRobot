# KarelRobot
Karel Robot done in Java


This seiries of Java files started as an early assignment creating a simply robot (ur-Robot) and expanded to include further functionality, a "super" robot, world with walls, beepers, and other robots.  All of the files are of my own design expect for "Direction.java", that file was provided to the class by our instructor.
